# @deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

MCP client bridge plugin: connects to external [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers and registers their tools on `ctx.tools`, making them available to the model as native tools under server-qualified names (`mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>`).

## Usage

One plugin instance per MCP server in `cordis.yml`:

```yaml
- id: mcp-github
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
  config:
    serverName: github
    transport: stdio
    command: npx
    args: ['-y', '@modelcontextprotocol/server-github']
    env:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: !!js process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN

- id: mcp-web
  name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client'
  config:
    serverName: web
    transport: streamable-http
    url: http://localhost:3000/mcp
    headers:
      Authorization: !!js '`Bearer ${process.env.MCP_TOKEN}`'
```

The model sees `mcp__github__create_issue`, `mcp__web__search`, … — the same server-qualified shape Claude Code and Codex use. HMR hot-swaps: editing the entry triggers disconnect + reconnect without process restart; an unchanged `serverName` reproduces identical tool names.

## Config

| Field | Transport | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `transport` | both | yes | `"stdio"` or `"streamable-http"` |
| `serverName` | both | yes | Namespace for this server's model-facing tool names; `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,32}`, unique across live instances |
| `command` | stdio | yes | Executable to spawn |
| `args` | stdio | no | Arguments passed to the command |
| `env` | stdio | no | Extra env vars merged on top of scrubbed ambient env |
| `cwd` | stdio | no | Working directory for the child process |
| `url` | http | yes | MCP server URL |
| `headers` | http | no | Extra headers (e.g. static auth tokens) |
| `auth.mode` | http | no | `"oauth"` switches the server to OAuth 2.0 authorization-code flow with PKCE (see [OAuth authentication](#oauth-authentication)) |
| `auth.scope` | http | no | Scope requested when the server does not advertise one; omission lets discovery decide |
| `auth.clientId` | http | no | Pre-registered client id; omission performs RFC 7591 dynamic registration on first consent |
| `auth.redirectPort` | http | no | Loopback port for the consent redirect; must match the consent CLI's `--redirect-port` (default `14506`) |
| `toolCallTimeoutMs` | both | no | Timeout per `callTool` invocation (default 60000) |
| `failOnStartupError` | both | no | Reject plugin activation when initial connection or tool synchronization fails (default `false`) |
| `reconnect.enabled` | both | no | Reconnect automatically after a lost connection (default `true`) |
| `reconnect.initialDelayMs` | both | no | First reconnect delay in ms; doubles per consecutive failed attempt (default 500) |
| `reconnect.maxDelayMs` | both | no | Backoff ceiling in ms; also the uptime after which the attempt budget resets (default 30000) |
| `reconnect.maxAttempts` | both | no | Consecutive failed attempts per outage before giving up for good (default 10) |

## Tool naming

Every MCP tool has two names: the raw MCP name (sent on the wire in `tools/call`) and the public name `mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>` registered on `ctx.tools`. Public names are normalized to the DeepSeek function-name contract (64 chars, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`); when replacement or truncation changes the name, a deterministic 12-hex-char hash of `(serverName, rawName)` is appended so distinct tools never collapse into one name. Names are pure functions of `(serverName, rawName)` — connection order, re-syncs, and other servers never rename a tool.

- Two servers publishing the same raw name (e.g. `search`) coexist under their namespaces.
- A duplicate `serverName` across live instances fails the later plugin instance at load.
- A server listing the same tool name twice is rejected as an invalid tool list.
- A foreign registration squatting on this server's namespace rolls back the whole generation (never a partial set), with a loud error.

## OAuth authentication

`auth: { mode: 'oauth' }` is explicit configuration, never an auto-started flow on an unexpected 401: consent is human approval of one identity grant, so it lives where a reviewer can see it. Configuring OAuth requires the credential-reference service (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-credentials-local`) to be mounted; the plugin instance rejects at load otherwise. Tokens ride the MCP SDK's Streamable HTTP support: attach on every request, refresh through the stored grant when the server answers 401, and re-consent only when refresh is refused.

State for one server — tokens, dynamic client registration, pending PKCE verifier, discovery cache — persists as ONE credential reference `DSH_MCP_OAUTH_<SERVERNAME>` (uppercased, non-identifier characters become underscores) in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`, written `0600`. Values resolve per operation, so state written by any process reaches every other process immediately.

First consent (headless-safe): run the consent CLI from this package on any machine that can open a URL.

```sh
dsh-mcp-client-auth --url https://mcp.example.com/mcp --server-name example
```

It prints the authorization URL, captures the redirect on `127.0.0.1:<auth.redirectPort>` (default `14506`; pass `--redirect-port` here AND in the plugin config when you change it), exchanges the code, and writes the tokens. A running host picks them up on its next connection attempt without a restart. When consent is missing, the host logs the same URL once with run-the-CLI guidance and keeps retrying under its normal reconnect budget; `--reset` starts the grant over.

## Behavior

- On connect: plugin activation awaits `listTools()` and registers each tool via `ctx.tools.register()` under its public name before the composition starts its first turn. Initial connection, discovery, or registration failure is always logged; it rejects activation when `failOnStartupError` is true and otherwise activates with no tools.
- Listens for `notifications/tools/list_changed` → re-syncs; a fetch-phase failure keeps the previous generation registered, while a registration conflict rolls back the attempted generation and leaves no tools from that server.
- Tool execute: `client.callTool({ name: rawName, arguments }, { signal })` with timeout + abort support—the public name is never sent to the server.
- Canonical success is `{ content: JsonValue[], structuredContent? }`; complete JSON MCP blocks survive for programmatic callers. A supported advertised `outputSchema` validates `structuredContent`; unsupported schema vocabulary falls back to unconstrained `JsonValue`.
- Native/model rendering preserves MCP block order. Text-like runs join with newlines; resource links keep their name and URI as text; supported images become durable core image blocks only when `ctx.attachments` is mounted and the exact calling model route explicitly declares image input. The whole image batch is decoded and admitted before any member is saved. A malformed/refused image batch, audio, embedded resources, and unsupported blocks become explicit diagnostic text rather than disappearing.
- On disconnect/crash: the supervisor restarts the original server config with exponential backoff (`reconnect.initialDelayMs` doubling up to `reconnect.maxDelayMs`) and re-runs discovery on success — the recovered generation replaces the previous one, so tools neither duplicate nor leak. During the outage the last good generation stays registered; calls against it fail until recovery.
- Reconnection is budgeted per outage: after `reconnect.maxAttempts` consecutive failures the server's tools are unregistered and reconnection stops until an HMR reload or Host restart. A connection that survives past `maxDelayMs` resets the budget, so an occasionally-crashing server recovers indefinitely while a crash-looping one — even with briefly successful connects — still exhausts the cap instead of restarting forever.
- Reconnect states are user-visible in logs: reconnecting (warn, with attempt count and delay), recovered (info), final failure and disabled-loss (error). Disposal cancels any pending reconnect. With `reconnect.enabled: false`, a lost connection keeps tools registered but failing until a reload — the manual-recovery behavior.

## Services consumed

|---|---|
| `ctx.tools` | Register/unregister MCP tools |
| `ctx.credentials` | Required for OAuth servers: read and persist token state per operation |
| `ctx.attachments` | Optionally validate and persist image result batches before model projection |
| `ctx.llm` | Optionally prove the exact calling route explicitly supports image input |

## Model Experience

### Discovered MCP tools

#### What the model sees

After initial discovery succeeds, each advertised MCP tool appears as a native tool named `mcp__<serverName>__<rawName>` (or its deterministic normalized form), with the server-provided description and input schema. A successful re-sync — including the one after an automatic reconnect — replaces the generation; plugin disposal or an exhausted reconnect budget removes it.

#### Token effect

Data-dependent schema cost is paid on every request while the tools are registered. Re-sync replaces rather than accumulates schemas, and the server-qualified name adds tokens to every tool definition and call.

#### KV Cache effect

Prefix-stable while the discovered tool set and schemas are unchanged. A re-sync that adds, removes, renames, or changes a tool replaces definitions and may invalidate reuse from the first changed schema token; a reconnect that recovers an unchanged list reproduces identical definitions and stays prefix-stable.

### Tool-call history and results

#### What the model sees

The public tool name and JSON arguments remain in assistant history. The execution-local canonical value always retains the complete JSON MCP blocks and optional structured content for programmatic and Code Mode callers. In Native context, supported image blocks are durably projected beside text in their original order after exact route-capability proof; Code Mode additionally ferries that settled rich projection through the outer `run_code` result without changing the canonical binding value. Refused images, audio, embedded resources, resource links, and unknown blocks remain visible as bounded text diagnostics, and MCP `isError` rejects the call before image persistence.

#### Token effect

Arguments, mapped text, and durable image references are retained until compaction. Inline MCP base64 stays only in the execution-local canonical value and is never copied into a session event; the provider reads verified bytes from the attachment store. Audio and embedded-resource payloads stay out of model context.

#### KV Cache effect

Append-only; newly visible content follows the reusable request prefix and does not invalidate existing KV-cache entries.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Tools are the only bridged MCP capability** — Resources and Prompts have no harness consumer and are deferred.
- **Startup timeout is inherited from the MCP SDK** — DSH does not yet expose a connection/discovery timeout. Each initialize or paginated `tools/list` request uses the SDK's 60-second default, so an unresponsive server or cursor chain can delay both activation and teardown while the initial synchronization settles.
- **Reconnect triggers on transport close** — a crashed stdio child fires it; Streamable HTTP failures surface per request and through the SDK transport's own SSE-stream recovery, so an unreachable HTTP server is retried per call rather than respawned by the supervisor.
- **Image is the only durable rich-result bridge** — PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF can enter Native context after exact capability proof. Audio and embedded-resource payloads remain execution-local with explicit diagnostics, while resource links preserve only their name and URI as text.
- **Unsupported MCP output schemas are not enforced** — `structuredContent` falls back to `JsonValue` when the advertised schema uses vocabulary outside the harness subset.
- **OAuth consent capture coordinates on one loopback port per server** — the host never listens; only the consent CLI does. Changing `auth.redirectPort` requires the same `--redirect-port` on the next CLI run, and two servers sharing a port cannot consent concurrently.
- **The consent CLI trusts the authorization server's redirect `state` handling to the SDK** — the CLI captures whatever code arrives on its listener without re-validating the `state` parameter, matching a single-user local-machine threat model.
- **OAuth servers are the only authenticated remotes** — static-token deployments keep using `headers`; there is no `apikey` auth mode by design (headers already cover it).
